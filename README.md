# Personal Portfolio

This is my [personal portfolio project](https://bennygo3.github.io/portfolio-react-remix/). 

I created this project to refresh my previous portfolio page, which had become a little bit stale and straightforward. 

I wanted to experiment and implement various technologies that were unfamiliar to me. I utilized Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign to create a few graphics for the projectâ€”some of which will remain behind the scenes (ðŸ˜¬). I explored and exhausted A LOT of different layouts and functionality. The good news is, this project hasn't gone stale. It might perpetually be in a state of 'almost done'!
